# Tic_tac_I_win

One of my first Android Apps.

Essentially you are playing against me, and I always win (or its a draw).

A simple TicTacToe, only you can never win it. 
Simply put, I have written a perfect algorithm for the game such that the player can never win. They can either loose or settle for a draw.

The algorithm is totally logic based without the use of any ML/AI technology (Commonly used).

Ps: Do let me know if you are able to beat my algorithm and win the game.

Regards
:)
